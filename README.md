# EnchantableMending

This plugin introduces a gameplay enhancement by making the Mending enchantment available through the enchantment table. Typically, Mending is obtained through gameplay mechanics like fishing, trading with villagers, or finding it as loot. However, this plugin modifies the enchantment table mechanics, allowing players to acquire the coveted Mending enchantment through the same process used for other enchantments.

## Customisation Options

### Enchantment Probability

Adjust the likelihood of getting Mending from the enchantment table to match server rarity preferences.

### Infinity Compatibility

Enable or disable combining Mending with Infinity.

### Max Enchantment Level

Decide whether Mending is restricted to the highest-level enchantments (Level 30).

## Installation

Place .jar file into the server's plugin folder.

## Usage

Customisation Options can be found in the configuration file.
